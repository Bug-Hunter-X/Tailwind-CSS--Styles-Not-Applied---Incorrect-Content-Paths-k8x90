```javascript
// ... your Tailwind CSS configuration ...
module.exports = {
  // ... your other configurations ...
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'], // Ensure your content array includes the correct paths to your HTML and components
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // ... your custom theme configurations ...
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```
This configuration might cause issues if the paths in the `content` array don't match your file structure. Double-check that the paths correctly point to your HTML files and any components you're using Tailwind in.  Also ensure that your JavaScript/TypeScript files where you're using Tailwind classes are within the specified directories or that the directories themselves are included. Incorrect paths are a common source of Tailwind compilation errors.
