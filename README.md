# Tailwind CSS - Styles Not Applied

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied to components due to incorrect paths specified in the `content` array of your `tailwind.config.js` file.

## Problem

When using Tailwind CSS, you need to specify the paths to your HTML files and components in the `content` array of your `tailwind.config.js`. If these paths are incorrect, Tailwind will not be able to find and process your classes, resulting in styles not being applied.  The lack of clear error messages can make this difficult to debug.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the paths specified in `content` to ensure that they accurately reflect the location of your files.  You should also ensure that your component files are using the correct imports and that the appropriate directives are in place (e.g., `@tailwind base;` etc.).

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Try to build the project. You'll find that Tailwind styles are missing.
4. Inspect the `tailwind.config.js` for the error. Correct the path to include the actual location of your files. The updated `tailwind.config.js` is included in this repo as `bugSolution.js`
